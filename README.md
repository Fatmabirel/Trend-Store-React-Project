# Trend-Store-React-Project


The aim of the Trend Store project is to create a market. In the created store, operations such as adding product information, listing the products added to the basket, and adding and deleting these products on the basket page can be done if desired. 

A product contains information such as product photo, name, price and score. These products listed on the homepage can be added and deleted when necessary.
